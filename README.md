A Machine Learning Model that uses Forex/Crypto candlestick data to project future trends in returns. Our model implements a Neural Network and LSTM method to
create the most accurate financial model using changes in prices and returns from the past six years. The data was pulled in a series of .txt files from the 
[Alpaca Stock and Crypto API](https://alpaca.markets/data) and the [FirstRate Data API](https://firstratedata.com/). This includes the high, low, open, 
and close prices on a minute by minute basis. More information on the used candle-wick model can be read [here](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/candlestick.asp#:~:text=A%20candlestick%20is%20a%20type,security%20for%20a%20specific%20period.).
